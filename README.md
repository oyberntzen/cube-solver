## Rubik's Cube Solver
#Changing the color of the cube:
    1. Orient the your cube using the color of the center of the faces. Use the helping colors around the cube in the program to rotate the your cube correctly.

    2. See which tile on the cube that is marked with a darker color.

    3. Press 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 depending on wich color you want that tile have.

    4. Repeat step 1-3 and if you do a mistake you can navigate forward and backwards with the arrow keys.

    5. When you are done and the program detects if it is a valid cube, the program will continue.
